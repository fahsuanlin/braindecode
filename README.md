# braindecode: decoding the brain signals

This project aims at "decode" brain signals recorded by either non-invasive or invasive human brain imaging tools, including MRI, EEG, and stereo-EEG, to estimate the audio-visual inputs to the invidividual.

## Goal

1. Estiamte the audio waveforms played to the individual (auditory, SEEG)

We have SEEG recording in the auditory cortex from three patients, who listened to music or cross-talk shows in Madarin. The goal is to estimate the audio input waveforms (music or speech) given SEEG data.

## Data

Refer to our [SEEG data](https://github.com/fahsuanlin/labmanual/wiki/32:-Sample-data:-SEEG-recording-during-music-listening) recorded during music playing
